1)	Provide a problem definition for the above problem. Be sure to include the format of the states, the initial state, possible actions, a transition model, the goal state, and the cost function.

Format: List of weights of people on each side and location of boat
Initial state: All people on southern bank, boat on southern bank
Possible actions: north(person), north(person1, person2), south(person), south(person1, person2)
Transition model: 
Goal state: All people on northern bank
Cost function: maximum of weights of people in boat


2)	If there are 4 men with weights 10, 20, 150, 200, how many possible states are reachable? What is the optimal time for this instance?

3)	Describe your heuristic for A* search.  Justify the heuristic’s admissibility.
