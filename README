1)	Provide a problem definition for the above problem. Be sure to include the format of the states, the initial state, possible actions, a transition model, the goal state, and the cost function.

Format: List of weights of people on each side and location of boat
Initial state: All people on southern bank, boat on southern bank
Possible actions: north(person1, person2), south(person)
Transition model: Everyone's current location after boat (with passengers) is moved
Goal state: All people on northern bank
Cost function: maximum of weights of people in boat


2)	If there are 4 men with weights 10, 20, 150, 200, how many possible states are reachable? What is the optimal time for this instance?

Assuming possible actions are sending 2 people north when boat is on south shore and sending 1 person south when boat is on north shore:
271 possible states
Optimal time: 390

3)	Describe your heuristic for A* search.  Justify the heuristic’s admissibility.

Heuristic is the minimum individual weight on the side that the boat is on. It is impossible to perform a single lower-cost transition than the heuristic, because the cost is the maximum of the weights of people on the boat, which will always be at least the weight of the lowest-weight person on the side with the boat.
